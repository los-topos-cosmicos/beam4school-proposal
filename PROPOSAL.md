# 🔬 BeamScan

### A Particle-Beam Material Classifier
### From Recycling to Heritage Science

**BL4S 2026 Proposal — Córdoba, Argentina 🇦🇷**

*Facility-agnostic: works at CERN T9 · DESY · ELSA*

---

</div>

## Motivation

We are students and teachers from the Instituto San Francisco de Asís in Santa Rosa de Calamuchita, Córdoba, Argentina. On the banks of the Río Santa Rosa, two materials defy identification without destroying them: Comechingón morteros carved in rock two thousand years ago, and mixed plastic waste arriving at local recycling cooperatives. The first is untouchable archaeological heritage. The second determines whether recycling is viable. Both pose the same challenge: compositional characterisation without destroying the sample.

We want to demonstrate that particle physics can solve both problems with the same non-destructive technique. Participating in BL4S would let us validate this method with a real beam and bring the results home to our communities.

## The Experiment

### Can we build a "BeamScan Atlas"?

A classification chart that identifies materials by measuring how charged particles scatter through them — demonstrated for two real-world domains in one experiment: **recycling quality control** and **heritage science**.

### The Physics: Multiple Coulomb Scattering

When a GeV-scale charged particle traverses matter, it undergoes many small deflections from atomic nuclei — **multiple Coulomb scattering (MCS)**. The resulting angular spread θ₀ depends on the material's **radiation length X₀**, a fundamental property set by elemental composition:

$$\theta_0 \approx \frac{13.6 \text{ MeV}}{p\beta c}\sqrt{\frac{x}{X_0}}\left[1 + 0.038\ln\left(\frac{x}{X_0}\right)\right]$$

Materials with heavier atoms have shorter X₀ and scatter the beam more. This is the fingerprint.

### Predicted Separation (Highland formula, PDG X₀ values)

All predictions are for **10 mm targets at 3 GeV/c**:

| Material | X₀ (cm) | θ₀ (mrad) | Category | Application |
|----------|---------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| PE | 47.9 | 0.559 | Plastic | Most common packaging |
| PP | 47.4 | 0.562 | Plastic | Food containers |
| PS | 42.5 | 0.596 | Plastic | Disposable cups, foam |
| Nylon | 36.7 | 0.646 | Plastic | Textiles, fishing nets |
| PMMA | 34.4 | 0.669 | Plastic | Plexiglass, lenses |
| PET | 28.7 | 0.738 | Plastic | Beverage bottles |
| **PVC** | **19.9** | **0.901** | **Plastic** | ⚠️ **Problem plastic — contaminates recycling** |
| | | *— gap —* | | *Organic ↔ inorganic divide* |
| SiO₂ | 12.3 | 1.170 | Heritage | Quartz — Comechingón morteros |
| CaCO₃ | 8.7 | 1.411 | Heritage | Marble, mortar, limestone |
| Al₂O₃ | 7.1 | 1.575 | Heritage | Ceramics, gemstones |
| Fe₂O₃ | 3.3 | 2.382 | Heritage | Red ochre pigment |

**PVC jumps out** because chlorine (Z = 17) is much heavier than C/H/O/N. Detecting PVC contamination in recycling streams is our **hero result**.

### Why the Gap Is a Feature, Not a Bug

<div align="center">
<img src="docs/figures/physics_explanation_gap.png" width="800" alt="Why the gap exists between plastics and minerals">

*Common matter splits into organic (C/H/O/N → long X₀) and inorganic (Si/Ca/Al/Fe → short X₀). No everyday natural material bridges this divide.*
</div>

The gap proves **MCS naturally sorts materials into compositional families**. Two clear clusters + one bridge (PVC) is more memorable, more classifiable, and a stronger scientific result than a smooth continuum.

### Discrimination Power

<div align="center">
<img src="docs/figures/discrimination_matrix.png" width="700" alt="Events needed for 3σ separation">

*Green = trivial (<100 events). Yellow = feasible (100–10k). Red = impractical (>100k). PE vs PP is honestly impossible. PVC vs anything is trivial.*
</div>

Our Geant4 simulations confirm that even PS vs PMMA needs fewer than 2,000 events (seconds of beam time). **PVC versus PE needs only ~50 events.** The full 11-material atlas requires under one hour.

## Experimental Setup

<div align="center">
<img src="docs/figures/setup_schematic.png" width="800" alt="Facility-agnostic BeamScan layout">

*Beam (1–6 GeV/c) → DWC₁, DWC₂ → **TARGET** → DWC₃, DWC₄. Pb-glass calorimeter is an optional extension.*
</div>

This is **facility-agnostic** — works with DWCs at CERN T9, beam telescopes at DESY, or tracking detectors at ELSA. No magnetic spectrometer required for the core measurement.

### Targets and Facility Considerations

BL4S rules: CERN and DESY accept only **non-combustible** targets; ELSA also permits combustible materials.

**At ELSA (preferred for full programme):** Plastics (PE, PP, PS, PMMA, PET, Nylon, PVC) + geological references (quartz, calcite, alumina, iron oxide). This gives us the PVC "hero result" and the recycling application.

**At CERN or DESY:** Non-combustible set only — geological references + graphite + metal foils (Al, Fe) as low-Z anchors. Still spans a wide X₀ range and demonstrates the full classifier concept.

All targets are solid samples in an aluminium holder. Safety data sheets provided.

### Measurement Program

| Phase | What | Events | Time |
|-------|------|--------|------|
| **1. Calibration** | No-target runs at both momenta | 10⁴ | ~30 min |
| **2. Core Atlas** | All materials × 2 momenta (3 & 6 GeV/c) × 10 mm | ≥10⁴ each | ~6 hours |
| **3. Systematics** | Thickness variation (5/10/20 mm) for PE, PVC, CaCO₃ | ≥10⁴ each | ~3 hours |
| **4. Extensions** | Contaminant sensitivity, composites, particle species | as available | remaining |

## The Deliverable: BeamScan Atlas

<div align="center">
<img src="docs/figures/classification_plot_final.png" width="800" alt="BeamScan Atlas — 2D classification plot">

*Each material is a point in (θ₀ at 3 GeV/c, θ₀ at 6 GeV/c) space. Plastics cluster bottom-left, minerals top-right, PVC bridges the gap. Both axes are MCS-only — no magnet needed.*
</div>

This single figure shows all materials on one plot. But note an important subtlety: because θ₀ ∝ 1/p exactly (the log correction has no momentum dependence), **all materials fall on the same line** with slope = p₁/p₂. The two-momentum plot is a **consistency check and systematics control**, not an independent second discriminator. Classification power comes from the extracted X₀ values. Where the facility offers additional observables (dE/dx, calorimeter response), we add a genuinely independent second axis.

## Simulation & Open Science

We built a complete simulation pipeline in this repository:
Our Geant4 simulations (11.3.2, FTFP_BERT, 2,000 events per configuration) validate the Highland predictions: across 10 of 11 materials at two momenta, Geant4 consistently exceeds Highland by 12 ± 3%, attributable to nuclear elastic scattering that the analytic formula omits. The exception is Fe₂O₃, where the ratio rises to ~1.4–1.5, directly revealing the larger hadronic cross-section of iron nuclei — itself a measurable physics result from the same BeamScan setup.

```
Student edits YAML → git push → GitHub Actions → plots appear in PR comment (~30 sec)
```

**Students don't need C++ or Geant4.** They copy a template, choose materials and beam energies, and push. The Highland calculator does the rest. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [docs/guides/STUDENT_GUIDE.md](docs/guides/STUDENT_GUIDE.md).

## What We Hope to Take Away

We want to return to Córdoba with three things:

1. A **validated BeamScan Atlas** proving that particle beams can classify materials non-destructively
2. The **experience** of designing, running, and analysing a real experiment at a world-class facility
3. A **story to share** — if students from Argentina can use a CERN beamline to help solve recycling challenges and study their country's archaeological heritage, it shows that fundamental physics belongs to everyone

We will share our results with local recycling cooperatives, schools, and museums — and publish everything openly so others can build on our work.

---

## Outreach

Before submitting this proposal, we organised a **"Physics Meets the Street"** event at a recycling cooperative in Córdoba. We brought samples of different plastics and demonstrated how difficult it is to distinguish PE from PP or detect PVC contamination by eye. We explained our BL4S idea: that accelerator particles can "see" the atoms inside a material, not just the surface.

If selected, we will expand this into a bilingual workshop series: **"Del acelerador al reciclaje"** (From the Accelerator to Recycling). We will bring our BeamScan Atlas to schools and cooperatives across Córdoba, and share our Geant4 simulation as an open educational resource with Spanish-language tutorials for students across Latin America.
