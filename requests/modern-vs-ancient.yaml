# 🔬 Can MCS distinguish modern cement from traditional mineral mixtures?
#
# We compare a traditional low-density mineral mixture
# with modern Portland-type cement using explicit
# radiation length (X0) and density values.
#
# Goal: evaluate if MCS can detect modern intervention
# in archaeological objects in a non-destructive way.
