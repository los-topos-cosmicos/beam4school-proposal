# Can MCS identify archaeological materials?
#
# The Comechingón peoples of the Sierras de Córdoba shaped quartz, calcite, and iron-oxide pigments into tools and morteros.
# If we can distinguish these minerals using particle beams, we gain a non-destructive tool for archaeology — no sample damage required.
