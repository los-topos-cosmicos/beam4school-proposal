description: "This analysis identifies the original raw materials of Comechingón artifacts (such as arrow points and mortars) based on quartz, calcite, alumina, and hematite. Modern plastics (PE, PVC, PET) are also included to detect recent restorations or contamination. Thus, it distinguishes original materials, temporal alterations, and modern layers, reconstructing the material biography of the archaeological objects."
