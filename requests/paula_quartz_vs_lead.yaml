# ─── Beam Settings ───
beam:
  particle: "e-"            # Electrons are great for seeing scattering at these energies
  momenta_GeV: [2.0, 5.0, 7.0] # Testing different energies to find the optimal sensitivity
  num_events: 25000         # High statistics to see small differences in the distribution tails

# ─── Target Materials ───
# We compare pure quartz against quartz with increasing thicknesses of lead
materials:
  - name: "SiO2"
    geant4_name: "G4_SILICON_DIOXIDE"
    thickness_mm: 10.0

  - name: "SiO2_Pb_0.1mm"
    geant4_name: "G4_Pb"    # Simulating a very thin 100-micron inclusion
    thickness_mm: 0.1

  - name: "SiO2_Pb_0.5mm"
    geant4_name: "G4_Pb"    # A half-millimeter inclusion
    thickness_mm: 0.5

  - name: "SiO2_Pb_1.0mm"
    geant4_name: "G4_Pb"    # A clear 1mm inclusion for calibration
    thickness_mm: 1.0

# ─── What to produce ───
outputs:
  highland_prediction: true 
  geant4_simulation: true   # Important: Lead has a high Z, we want the full Monte Carlo physics
  classification_plot: true  # This will show if the Pb "fingerprint" is distinct from Quartz
  distribution_overlay: true # This will show how the Gaussian peak widens with the Pb inclusion
  comparison_table: true
